We invite all practitioners to try. the data services and provide feedback & help us improve with community contribution! \n\n The participants will receive a access to try out the data service offering of ionir ( and if you are lucky will receive a gift card sponsored by ionir) \n According to the Data on Kubernetes 2021 Report, organizations are twice as productive after adopting Kubernetes to manage their data and workloads. The majority of organizations who have implemented \n DevOps have also adopted Kubernetes data services. With the ability to access data in real-time, DevOps organizations are using Kubernetes data services to gain a competitive advantage. As business demands increase, we can expect to see more organizations adopting data services to achieve faster, more efficient, and scalable DevOps operations. If you havenâ€™t already adopted data services into your organization, \n the time is now.",

    "description": "Functional programming has been around for at least five to six years. Multiple languages have adopted functional programming paradigm. In today's meetup, we shall look at two major languages in the context of Functional Programming -- JavaScript and Java 8+. JavaScript's Functional Programming allows us to study and implement Functional Techniques, Data Types and Interaction with the DOM. With Java 8+, we shall cover Lambdas and Streams, patterns, best practices, and anti-patterns. This is an information-packed unique session where two major languages supporting Functional Programming are addressed in a single meeting. Come, have fun, learn hands-on some latest technology, participate in Q&A and network -- all geared for your success. Multiple similar sessions and technology guidance is designed throughout the most of 2020. Our sole intention is for everyone to land a better workplace, better pay and more job satisfaction through an exciting journey with us. Make sure that you and your friends attend ALL the sessions planned through this meetup in the first quarter of 2020!",
